Hello!

I've been working for the last 7 years as a software engineer and software consultant. I've worked with teams in Shanghai, New York, and now London.

In 2017, I founded [Thimble](https://thimble.dev), a software consulting firm focused on helping companies shape the software that powers their business. I originally started Thimble with the goal of working with startups during those early growth phases during which a companyâ€™s technical foundations can play a key role in its survival.

With Thimble, I've had the pleasure of working with companies in both London and New York. I've worked with [Casper](https://casper.com), [Florence](https://florence.co.uk), and [Felcana](https://felcana.com). Before Thimble, I worked at [Plated](https://plated.com), [Gigabase](http://gigabase.org), alongside other gigs, projects, and (failed) startup ideas.
