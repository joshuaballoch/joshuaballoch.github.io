Hey there!

I've been working for the last 6 years as a software engineer and software consultant. I've worked with teams in Shanghai, New York, and now London.

Most recently, I've been working as the interim Head of Technology at a Pet Technology startup in London called [felcana](felcana.com), helping them build out their core tech services, building out the team, and helping them get to production.

I've previously worked with [Casper](casper.com), [Florence](florence.co.uk), [Plated](plated.com), [Gigabase](gigabase.org), alongside other gigs, projects, and (failed) startup ideas.

I currently work with companies on a consulting and advisory basis. If you're interested in working together, or just want to get coffee and meet up, drop me an email!
